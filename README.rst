Bering - Spatial Segmentation and Cell Annotation in Python
================================================

**Bering** is a deep learning algorithm for simultaneous molecular annotation and cell segmentation in single-cell spatial transcriptomics data. 
It builds on top of `torch_geometric`_ and `scanpy`_, from which it inherits modularity and scalability.
It provides versatile models that leverages the spatial coordinates of the data, as well as pre-trained models across spatial technologies and tissues.

Visit our `documentation`_ for installation, tutorials, examples and more.

Bering's key applications
--------------------------
- Identify background and real signals in noisy spatial transcriptomics data.
- Identify cell annotations for transcripts on single-cell spatial data.
- Efficiently cell segmentation with cell annotations.
- Build and fine-tune pre-trained model on new data using transfer learning.

Installation
------------
Install Bering via PyPI by running::

    pip install Bering

or via Conda as::

    conda install -c conda-forge Bering
